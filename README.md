## Local setup:

1. Download and install nodejs(preferably version >= v14.x) based on the Operating system
   from [NodeJs download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

2. Download and install docker from [Docker download](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)

3. Clone the repo to the local machine

   ```java
   git clone https://github.com/sudharsan-selvaraj/codetest-vcc.git
   ```

4. Change the working directory to the cloned repo

   ```
   cd codetest-vcc
   ```

5. Install the dependencies

   ```
   npm install
   ```

6. Install required browsers (eg. chrome or firefox)

7. Start the selenium server.

   ```java
   npm run webdriver:update 
   npm run webdriver:start
   ```

The above command will download and install selenium server jar file and necessary driver executables and starts the
selenium server at `http://localhost:4444/wd/hub`

8. Run the tests

   ```java
   npm run test
   ```

## Framework overview:

1. The framework is designed to
   use [Page object model](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/guidelines_and_recommendations/page_object_models/)
   to separate the business logics from webdriver io API
2. For each page in the application, individual page/component classes are created under [pages](./test/pages) directory
   with respective page name. For example, Page Objects for Campaign page is created
   as [page/campaign](./test/pages/campaign).
3. Each repetitive/common UI elements are created as individual resuable components.
   refer [car-model.component.js](./test/pages/campaign/components/car-model.component.js)
4. The test execution can be easily controlled using CLI arguments.
5. Tests can be executed directly form the machine or it can be packaged into a Docker image.

## Writing the first test:

### WebDriverIO overview:

[WebDriver.io](https://webdriver.io/) is a javascript based e2e test automation tools for testing web(using DevTools and
webdriver protocol) and mobile apps(using Appium)

#### Quick example:

```javascript
browser.url("https://www.google.com/");
$("*[name='q']").sendKeys("WebdriverIO");
expect($("*[name='q']").getValue()).toEqual("WebDriverIO");
```

#### Sync and Async mode:

Javascript is by default asynchronous in nature, we need to deal with lots of callbacks and promise to make our tests
run in sequence.

To overcome the above issue, since `ECMAScript 2017`, async and await is introduced to write much cleaner javascript
code by eliminating the need to use promises.
Check [async/await documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Async_await) to
understand it in detail.

As mentioned before, Webdriver IO is a JS based framework thus all the methods exposed by browser/element object will
return the promise. We need to carefully use async/await keywords to make our tests run in a sequence.

Currently, webdriver IO supports two modes of execution,

1. Sync
2. Async

#### Async mode:

In async mode, We need to explicitly add async/await statement before each method calls to make our test wait for the
response from the brpwser. Sample code using await keyword

```javascript
async function SearchGoogle() {
    await browser.url("https://www.google.com/");
    await (await $("*[name='q']")).sendKeys("WebdriverIO");
    expect(await $("*[name='q']").getValue()).toEqual("WebDriverIO");
}
```

#### Sync Mode:

If you're using @wdio/sync then you can avoid awaiting for command calls. That means, Webdriver IO has inbuilt
capability(with the help of [node-fiber](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fibers) ) to wait till response is reutned from
async methods, Sample code using sync mode:

```javascript
function SearchGoogle() {
    browser.url("https://www.google.com/");
    $("*[name='q']").sendKeys("WebdriverIO");
    expect($("*[name='q']").getValue()).toEqual("WebDriverIO");
}
```

ðŸš¨ But, As of 14/04/2021 sync mode will not be supported anymore starting from Node.js v16 due to changes in Chromium.
So we have to use `Async` mode by default to write out tests.

#### Overcoming the problems in Async mode:

It's now clear that by choosing `Async` it is now necessary to introduce `await` keywork before each and every
asyncronous methods. For example,

```javascript
$(".username").setValue("john");
```

The above code will throw `$(...).setValue is not a function`. To fix this, we need to wrap it with `await` keyword

```javascript
await (await $(".username")).setValue("john");
```

Also, it is impossible to chain the element selector to find hierarchical elements.

```javascript
$(".login-container").$(".username").setValue("john");
```

The above line of code will not work.

To overcome this problem, I have created a new wrapper class [FluentElement](./test/services/fluent-element.service.js)
which eliminates the use of await before each element interactions.

### FluentElement:

WebDriver IO will expose, `$` and `$$` functions to identify the elements from the page.

I have created a new WebDriverIO service `FluentElementService` which exposes, `$f`, `$css`, `$xpath`, `$id`
, `$linkText`, `$partialLinkText` functions for easy identification of elements.

Example without using `FluentElement`:

```javascript
var loginContainer = await $(".login-container");
var username = await loginContainer.$("#username");
var loginButton = await loginContainer.$(".login-button");
await username.setValue("john");
await loginButton.click();

```

Using `FluentElement`:

```javascript
await $css(".login-container").$id("username").setValue("John");
await $css(".login-container").$css(".login-button").click();
```

### Creating the page object:

Before writing the test for any new module, its important to create the necessary pageobjects and component.

1. Create a directory with the name of the module under [pages](./test/pages) folder.
2. If the page contains multiple complex sections, then individual sections can be created to make the page class neat
   and clean.
3. Any reusable components for that specific page can be created under [components](./test/pages/campaign/components)
   directory.

Sample directory structure for campaign page is

```
.
â””â”€â”€ pages/
    â””â”€â”€ campaign/ (Module name)
        â”œâ”€â”€ components/
        â”œâ”€â”€ sections/
        â””â”€â”€ index.js
```

Sample UI component for car model carousel displayed in campaign page can be created as:
<p align="center">
<img src="./docs/assets/car-model.png" width=150 height=150/>
</p>

```javascript
class CarModel {

    constructor(parentElement) {
        if (!parentElement["wrappedElement"]) {
            parentElement = new FluentElement(null, parentElement)
        }
        this.parentElement = parentElement;
        this.categoryEle = parentElement.$attr("data-autoid", "productListCarouselItem:category");
        this.modelNameEle = parentElement.$attr("data-autoid", "productListCarouselItem:modelName");
        this.rechargeTypeEle = parentElement.$attr("data-autoid", "productListCarouselItem:rechargeType");
        this.learnLink = parentElement.$attr("data-autoid", "productListCarouselItem:link1");
        this.shopLink = parentElement.$attr("data-autoid", "productListCarouselItem:link2");
    }

    categoryName() {
        return getText(this.categoryEle);
    }

    modelName() {
        return getText(this.modelNameEle);
    }

    rechargeType() {
        return getText(this.rechargeTypeEle)
    }

    getImgSrc() {
        return getAttribute(this.parentElement.$css("img"), "src");
    }

}
```

The above component can be used in the tests as

```javascript
var carModel = await CampaignPage.ExploreSection.getModel(0); // returns the first car model displayed in the carousel
expect(await self.carModel.categoryName()).toEqual("SUV");
expect(await self.carModel.modelName()).toEqual("XC90 Recharge");
```

### Organizing the test:

Since we are dealing with the responsive application, we need to test the behaviour with different screen resolutions in
different browsers and mobile devices.

So, we need some way to organize the tests based on the screen size to make it flexible during executions.

Example:

To write test for [campaign page](https://www.volvocars.com/intl/v/car-safety/a-million-more), create a folder with
name  `campaign` under [specs](./test/specs) directory

##### Folder Structure:

```
.
â””â”€â”€ specs/
    â””â”€â”€ campaign/ (Module name)
        â”œâ”€â”€ campaign-common.spec.js
        â”œâ”€â”€ campaign-small-screen.spec.js
        â””â”€â”€ campaign-large-medium-screen.spec.js
```

`campaign-common.spec.js` - tests that are applicable for all screen sizes
`campaign-small-screen.spec.js` - tests that are only applicable for large and medium screen sizes
`campaign-large-medium-screen.spec.js` - tests that are only applicable for large and medium screen sizes

By organizing this way, we can easily customise the test execution by just running the specific tests based on the
screen size.

### Executing the tests:

The framework supports fully customisable execution based on CLI parameters. We can easily execute tests across
different browsers with different screen resolutions in parallel.

I have currently used 3 different screen resolutions under which the application need to be tested.

1. `large` - 1792x1097 Desktop resolution(macbook pro)
2. `medium` - 1024x1366 Tab resolution(Ipad pro)
3. `small` - 375x667 Mobile resolution(Iphone 6s)

Also, i have created a Custom webdriver io
service [browser-capabilities.services.js](./test/services/browser-capabilities.services.js) that will take care of
setting the browser screen size during runtime based on the passed screensize

Example:

```shell
   npm run test --browsers "chrome" --screens "large,small"
```

The above command will open two different browsers with screensize `1792x1097` and `375x667` and executes the test
respectively.

We can also reuse the tests to be executed in browsers installed on real mobile devices.

Create a new mobile config in [device-config.json](./device-config.json) file and pass `--devices <device name>` to run
the tests in specific device

```json
{
  "google_pixel_chrome": {
    "browserName": "chrome",
    "platformName": "Android",
    "appium:deviceName": "Google Pixel 3",
    "appium:platformVersion": "9.0",
    "opt:screenSize": "small",
    "bstack:options": {
      "deviceName": "Google Pixel 3",
      "realMobile": true,
      "osVersion": "9.0"
    }
  },
  "iphone_12_pro_safari": {
    "browserName": "safari",
    "platformName": "iOS",
    "appium:platformVersion": "14",
    "appium:deviceName": "iPhone 12",
    "appium:automationName": "XCUITest",
    "bstack:options": {
      "deviceName": "iPhone 12 Pro",
      "realMobile": true,
      "osVersion": "14"
    },
    "opt:screenSize": "small"
  }
}
```

`opt:screenSize": "small"` value inside the device config object will be used to determine what are all the tests that
need to be executed for the specific browser.

```shell
npm run test --browsers "chrome" --screens "large,small" --devices "iphone_12_pro_safari,google_pixel_chrome"
```

To run the browsers in headless mode, pass `--headless` as additional flag.

The above command will open two different browsers with screensize `1792x1097` and `375x667` and launches chrome
in `Google pixel` and safari in `IPhone 12 pro` executes the test respectively.

1. Browser launched with large screen resolution will
   execute `[campaign-common.spec.js, campaign-large-medium-screen.spec.js]`
2. Browser launched with small screen resolution will execute `[campaign-common.spec.js, campaign-small-screen.spec.js]`
3. Browser launched in mobile with small screen resolution will
   execute `[campaign-common.spec.js, campaign-small-screen.spec.js]`

#### Sample execution demo:

<p align="center">
<img src="./docs/assets/execution_demo.gif"/>
</p>

The logic for determining the spec is as below. Refer [wdio.conf.js](./wdio.conf.js)

```javascript
args.browsers.forEach(function (browser) {
    args.screens.forEach(function (screen) {
        capabilities.push({
            browserName: browser,
            [CapabilityOptions.HEADLESS]: args.headless,
            [CapabilityOptions.SCREEN_SIZE]: screen,
            maxInstances: args.maxInstances,
            specs: merge(args.specs, [`${TEST_ROOT_DIR}/**/*${screen}*screen.spec.js`])
        })
    });
});
```

### Reports:

Once the tests are executed, HTML report will be generated along with the screenshots for the failed tests.

Check the sample
report [Execution Report](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/sudharsan-selvaraj/codetest-vcc/blob/main/docs/report.html) (It will take
approx 30-60s to open the HTML file)

Webdriver IO provides customizable options to generate customized reports based on the project needs. So we can easily
tweek any existing reporting framework and create our own report based on the requirements.

### Docker Setup:

I have used [`Zalenium`](https://opensource.zalando.com/zalenium/) framework for running selenium tests inside docker
conatiners

Advantages:

1. Zalenium supports auto-scaling of selenium nodes based on the request received from the tests.
2. Supports proxy for various cloud providers (Browserstack, sauce labs, etc)
3. Provided ability see the live test execution using no-vnc service.

### Execution steps

1. Make sure the docker service is up and running by typing the below command
   ```shell
   docker -v
   ```

2. Update the values in [.env](./.env) file
   ```dotenv
   BROWSER_STACK_USER=broserstack_username
   BROWSER_STACK_KEY=broserstack_key
   BROWSERS="chrome,firefox"
   SCREENS="small,medium,large"
   DEVICES="google_pixel_chrome,chrome_iphone_6"
   ```

3. Start the zalenium service
   ```shell
   docker-compose up -d zalenium
   ```
   Above command will pull `elgalu/selenium` and `dosel/zalenium` docker images and will start the selenium server
   at `https://localhost:4444/wd/hub`
   on opening `http//localhost:4444/wd/hub`, you can see the selenium grid with 3 nodes
   <p align="center">
   <img src="./docs/assets/zalenium-console.png"/>
   </p>

3. Run tests
   ```shell
   docker-compose up e2e
   ```
   Above command will build the e2e docker image if not present already and will execute the tests.
